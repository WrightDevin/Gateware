\hypertarget{index_Install}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_Install}
Gateware Libraries supports four deployment types\+: Static Libraries, Implicit D\+L\+Ls, Explicit D\+L\+Ls, and Source code if needed.

See distributed zip file for more details.\hypertarget{index_API}{}\section{A\+P\+I Overview}\label{index_API}
The goal of this A\+PI is to provide efficient, cross-\/platform libraries that handle functionality common to games and apps and work on all major platforms (Mac, Linux, Windows). The interfaces are intended to be light-\/weight and easy to use so end-\/users (students) can easily integrate them into their own projects.\hypertarget{index_APIGLog}{}\subsection{G\+Log}\label{index_APIGLog}
The G\+Log library is intended to provide a simple way to log information to a file. This functionality is most useful for implementing error logging. This library supports binary and text file output and also has options for concurrent logging to console. The G\+Log library makes heavy use of the G\+File library to interface with platform specific file IO.\hypertarget{index_APIGFile}{}\subsection{G\+File}\label{index_APIGFile}
The G\+File library is intended to provide a simple interface that can open, read from and write binary or U\+T\+F-\/8 encoded text to files on any major platform. G\+File also has support for getting and setting a current working directory, as well as retrieving all file names from said directory.\hypertarget{index_APIGInput}{}\subsection{G\+Input}\label{index_APIGInput}
The goal of the G\+Input library is to provide a multi-\/platform interface for accurately handling high-\/speed keyboard and mouse input. This type of raw input handling is useful for games that need to get real-\/time user input and react to it quickly. Users can also query the state of individual keys, as well as get mouse position data.\hypertarget{index_APIGBufferedInput}{}\subsection{G\+Buffered\+Input}\label{index_APIGBufferedInput}
G\+Buffered input provides a similar function to G\+Input, but implements an event based system that is reacting to platform specific keyboard and mouse input events, instead of catching raw input. G\+Buffered\+Input is directly derived from G\+Broadcast, meaning it must have a Listener attached to it to function. This type of input is more useful in any situation where speed is not as important, like navigating menus and entering text into fields.\hypertarget{index_Reporting}{}\section{Bug Reporting}\label{index_Reporting}
Each team that Gateware deploys to will designate one team member to be their Reporter. The Reporter will post bugs to the Gateware Underdog page on behalf of their team.
